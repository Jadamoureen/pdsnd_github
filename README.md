Project III and README file was created on Mon 11th October 2021

### Bikeshare Project 

In this project, one had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Writing code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. As well as writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Overview 

The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.


### Requirements 
This program was written in Python (Version 3.8.5) and relies on the following libraries:
1. Pandas  1.3.2
2. Numpy 1.21.0

The “time” module allows us to handle various operations regarding time in the bikeshare project.
